==================================

* In Oracle , a ROWNUM is a pseudocolumn (not a real column) that is available in a query and indicates the row number in a RESULT SET retrieved by an SQL query

* For each row returned by a query,the ROWNUM pseudocolumn returns a number indicating the order in which Oracle selects rows from a table or set of joined rows. 

* The first row selected has a ROWNUM of 1, the second has 2, and so on.

* We can use ROWNUM to limit the number of rows returned by a query, as in this example:
- SELECT * FROM emp WHERE ROWNUM < =5;


# WAQ to display the name and salary of 3 employees who earn more than 2000.
- select empno, ename, sal from emp where sal > 2000 and rownum <= 3;

     EMPNO ENAME             SAL

##  Top N Analysis ===>
=======================

* Top-N analysis orTop-N queries are useful in scenarios where the need is to display only the n top-most or the n bottommost records from a table based on a condition.

* For example, using Top-N analysis you can perform the following types of queries:
- Top three earners in the company.
- Four most recent recruits in the company.
- Top two sales reps who have sold the maximum number of products.
- Top three products that have had maximum sales in the last six months.

* Syntax :- 
- SELECT <list_of_cols> FROM (your ordered query) alias_name WHERE rownum <= Rows_to_return

-  select ename, sal from (select ename, sal from emp order by sal desc) temp where rownum <= 3;
