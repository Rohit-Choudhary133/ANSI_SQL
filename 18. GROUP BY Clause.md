==============================

* The GROUP BY clause is used in a SELECT statement to grouprows into a set of summary rows by values of columns or expressions.

* The GROUP BY clause then returns one row per group.

* The GROUP BY clause is often used with aggregate functions such as AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN() and SUM(). 

* Syntax:
- SELECT column_list FROM <table_name> GROUP BY <col_name>;


# WAQ to display number of employees in each department.
- select deptno, count(*) from emp group by deptno;

    DEPTNO   COUNT(*)
---------- ----------
        30          6
        20          5
        10          3


# WAQ to display average salary of each department.
- select deptno, avg(sal) from emp group by deptno;

    DEPTNO   AVG(SAL)
---------- ----------
        30 1566.66667
        20       2175
        10 2916.66667


# WAQ to display number of employees hired every year.
- select to_char(hiredate, 'YYYY') as Year, count(*) from emp group by to_char(hiredate, 'YYYY');

YEAR   COUNT(*)
---- ----------
1987          2
1980          1
1982          1
1981         10


# WAQ to display max salary of each job.
- select job, max(sal) from emp group by job;

JOB         MAX(SAL)
--------- ----------
CLERK           1300
SALESMAN        1600
PRESIDENT       5000
MANAGER         2975
ANALYST         3000



## GROUP BY And NULL =====>
===========================

# When we GROUP BY a column that contains NULL values for some rows, all the rows with NULL values are placed into a single group and presented as one summary row in the output.

-  select comm, count(*) from emp where comm is not null group by comm;

      COMM   COUNT(*)
---------- ----------
      1400          1
       500          1
       300          1
         0          1


##  Filtering Results Of Group By (Having) ===>
===============================================

* To filter the results of GROUP BY , we can use HAVING clause.

* The purpose of the HAVING clause is to eliminate groups, just as the WHERE clause is used to eliminate rows.

* If a query has a HAVING clause along with a GROUP BY clause, the result set will include only the groups that satisfy the condition specified in the HAVING clause.

# WAQ to display number of emp in each dept, consider only dept 10 & 20;
-  select deptno, count(*) from emp group by deptno having deptno in (10, 20);

    DEPTNO   COUNT(*)
---------- ----------
        20          5
        10          3


##  WHERE vs HAVING ===>
========================

* WHERE can only be used to filter on the basis of scalar values and not on the basis of group functions.

* WHERE does not allow using GROUP FUNCTIONS as the results of the aggregate function cannot be determined until after the grouping takes place.


##  Can We Use Both WHERE and HAVING Together ?
===============================================

* Yes, it is possible to use both WHERE and HAVING in the same query and this sometimes becomes essential too.

* This happens when we want to filter both on the basis of SCALAR VALUE as well as on the basis of a GROUP FUNCTION result.

# WAQ to display no of employees in each department who get a comm and where the MINIMUM sal is greater than 1000.
- select deptno, count(*) from emp where comm is not null group by deptno having min(sal) > 1000;

    DEPTNO   COUNT(*)
---------- ----------

# WAQ to display number of employees hired every month.
- select to_char(hiredate,'MON') as MONTH, count(*) from emp group by to_char(hiredate,'MON');
