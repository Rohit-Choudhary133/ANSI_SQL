========================================

* From Oracle 9i onwards , Oracle has provided us new syntax for joins.

* These are called ANSI JOIN SYNTAX.

* Their benefit is that , they make the query more readable as well as support FULL OUTER JOIN which is not supported by traditional syntax of join given by Oracle.


# Cross Join ===>
=================

* Syntax:
- Select <col_names> From <table 1> CROSS JOIN <table2>;

* Example:
select ename, dname from emp CROSS JOIN dept;

ENAME      DNAME

# Equi Join ===>
================

* Syntax:
- Select <col_names> From <table 1> INNER JOIN <table2> On <table1.col>=<table2.col> [Where <cond>];

* The keyword INNER is optional , so we also can just write JOIN

# WAQ to display ename ,sal and dname of all the employees in the company.
- select ename,sal,dname from emp inner join dept on emp.deptno = dept.deptno;
