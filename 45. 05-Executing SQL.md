========================

* From the body of a PL-SQL script we are only allowed to execute DML and TCL statements i.e INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE,COMMIT, ROLLBACK are the only valid SQL commands which can be executed from a PL-SQL script.

* Execution of SELECT is allowed but with the help of CURSOR.


##  Executing INSERT ===>
=========================

# WAP to accept values for roll_no , name , per columns and insert the record in the table STUDENTS.

* For writing the above script we will require 4 variables declared to be of the same data type and size as the 3 columns of the table STUDENTS.

* This is done use %TYPE attribute.

* The %TYPE attribute allow you to declare a constant, variable, or parameter to be of the same data type as an existing database column.

* Syntax :-
# <var_name> <table_name>.<col_name>%TYPE;

* Example :-
# roll Student.roll_no%TYPE;

1  declare
2  roll students.roll_no%type;
3  name students.name%type;
4  per students.per%type;
5  begin
6  roll := &roll_no;
7  name := '&name';
8  per := '&per';
9  insert into students values(roll, name, per);
10 dbms_output.put_line('Insert Successfully');
11 commit;
12 end;


##  Executing DELETE ===>
=========================

# WAP to accept value for roll_no from the user and delete the record of that student from the table STUDENTS.

1  declare
2  roll students.roll_no%type;
3  begin
4  roll := &roll_no;
5  delete from students where roll_no = roll;
6  dbms_output.put_line('Record Deleted');
7  commit;
8 end;


##  Executing UPDATE ===>
=========================

# WAP to accept value for roll_no and per from the user and increase the per of the student with the given roll_no by adding the given per in the table STUDENTS.

1  declare
2  roll students.roll_no%type;
3  p students.per%type;
4  begin
5  roll := &roll_no;
6  p := &per;
7      upadte students set per = per + p where roll_no = roll;
8      dbms_output.put_line('Record Updated');
9      commit;
10  end;


##  PL-SQL Select Into ===>
===========================

* PL/SQL SELECT INTO statement is the simplest and fastest way to fetch a single row from a table into variables.

* The following illustrates the syntax of the PL/SQL SELECT INTO statement :-
SELECT column_list
INTO variable_list
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

# WAP to accept a roll_no from the user and display the name of the student from the table STUDENTS.
1  declare
2  roll students.roll_no%type;
3  naam students.name%type;
4  begin
5  roll := &roll_no;
6  select name into naam
7  from students where roll_no = roll;
8  dbms_output.put_line('Name is ' || naam);
9 end;


## Selecting Complete Row ===>
==============================

# WAP to accept a roll_no from the user and display the complete record of the student from the table STUDENTS.


## Select Into Common Errors ===>
=================================

* If the number of columns and expression in the SELECT clause is greater than the number of variables in the INTO clause, Oracle issues this error:
# ORA-00947: not enough values

* Oracle issues the following error if the number of columns and expression in the SELECT clause is less than the number of variables in the INTO clause:
# ORA-00913: too many values
