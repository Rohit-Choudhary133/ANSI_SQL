==============================


They are listed below:-
- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Set operators 
- Miscellaneous Operators


## Arithmetic Operators ===>
============================

* Arithmetic operators manipulate numeric operands as well as date operands.
* There are 6 Arithmetic operators in Oracle and they are:

+ (unary) : Makes operand positive
- (unary) : Negates operand
/         : Division (numbers and dates)
*         : Multiplication
+         : Addition (numbers and dates)
-         : Subtraction (numbers and dates)


##  Comparison Operators ===>
=============================

* Comparison operators are used in conditions and compare one expression with another .
* The result of a comparison can be TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN.

=           : Equality Operator
<>, !=, ^=  : Not Equality Operator
>           : Greater Than Operator
<           : Less Than Operator
>=          : Greater Than or Equal to Operator
<=          : Less Than or Equal to Operator


##  Logical Operators ===>
==========================

* Logical operators combine the results of two-component conditions to produce a single result.
* Logical operators provided by Oracle are:

AND  : Logical Conjunction Operator
OR   : Logical Disjunction Operator
NOT  : Logical Negation Operator


##  Miscellaneous Operators ===>
================================

* Following are a few more built-in operators which can’t be categorized in any of the previous categories so we call them miscellaneous operators.

||                     : Concatenation
IN , NOT IN            : Comparison for a value in a specified list
BETWEEN , NOT BETWEEN  : Comparison based on range of values
LIKE , NOT LIKE        : Used for pattern matching
IS ,IS NOT             : Used for comparing NULL values


## XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


# Format Command ===>
=====================

* Syntax :-
- Column <column_name> format <format_details>;

* Format details , are dependent on the type of column we want to format.

* For numbers , we use the number 9 as many times as we want max number of digits.
* For example, to set the width of sal column to 5 digits we would write :
- Column sal format 99999;

* For varchar2, we use the pattern AX where X is the number indicating the width we want to set.
* For example, to set the width of ename column to 4 characters we would write :
- Column ename format A4;


# Pattern Matching Using " LIKE Operator " ===>
===============================================

* In Oracle, we may not always know the exact value to search for, sometimes we may want to select rows that match a certain character pattern.

* For example:
- All employees whose name starts with ‘M’
- All employees whose job title ends with ‘R’
- All customers whose phone number does not begin with +91

* Two symbols can be used to construct the search string:
- % : The percent (%) sign, represents any sequence of characters (0 or more).
- _ : The underscore (_) sign, represents any single character.
