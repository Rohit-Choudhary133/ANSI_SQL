=============================

* Multi Row SubQueries are those where the inner query generates multiple values .

* In such case we cannot use SINGLE VALUED OPERATORS in the WHERE clause of outer query , otherwise Oracle will give syntax error.

* So , for Multi Row Subqueries , Oracle provides us MULTI VALUED OPERATORS for comparison and these are in ,any , some and all.
