===================================


* Definition:- A subquery is a SELECT statement nested inside another statement such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

* Purpose:- Many times when we write a query in Oracle ,we might want to compare a column or expression with the result of another query.

* It happens when we donâ€™t know the exact value with which this comparison will be done but we know the query that will generate this value. This is where we use SUBQUERIES.

* Syntax:-
- Select <list_of_cols> From <table_name> Where <col_name> <operator>(Select <col_name> From <table_name> where <test_cond>);

* Points To Remember:-
- Subqueries must always be nested within parenthesis.
- We can have this nesting up to 255 levels.
- In a simple subquery, the inner query is executed once, before the execution of the outer query.


##  Types Of SubQuery ===>
==========================

* Oracle supports 4 types of subqueries which are:
- Single Row Subquery
- MultiRow Subquery
- Corelated Subquery
- MultiColumn Subquery


#  Single Row SubQuery ===>
===========================

* If the subquery returns a single value then it becomes a SINGLE ROW SUBQUERY .

* In such cases the WHERE clause of outer query can contain only SINGLE VALUED OPERATORS like = , != , > , < , >= , <= .
