=========================

* It is the least popular form of JOIN and is generally not used.

* It happens when in the FROM clause of a SELECT query we mention 2 or more tables without using any condition.

* The CROSS JOIN specifies that all rows from first table are joined with all of the rows of second table. If there are "x" rows in table1 and "y" rows in table2 then the CROSS JOIN result set have x*y rows.

* For Example:
- Select ename,dname From emp,dept;

* When the above query is executed ,the output will be every possible combination of ENAME and DNAME , without matching their DEPTNO.
