==========================

* PL-SQL provides the following types of looping statements :-
- Basic Loop
- While Loop
- For Loop


##  Basic Loop ===>
===================

* This loop statement is the simplest loop structure in PL/SQL.

* The execution block starts with keyword 'LOOP' and ends with the keyword 'END LOOP'.

* Syntax :-

LOOP
    statements;
    EXIT WHEN condition;
END LOOP; 

OR

LOOP
    statements;
    IF <condition> THEN
        EXIT;
    ENDIF
END LOOP; 


# WAP to display first 10 natural numbers.

declare
i int;
begin
    i := 1;
    loop
      dbms_output.put_line(i);
        exit when i = 10;
        i := i + 1;
    end loop;
end;

OR

declare
i int;
begin
i := 1;
    loop
        dbms_output.put(i);
        exit when i = 10;
        i := i + 1;
    end loop;
    dbms_output.new_line;
end;


#  WAP to accept an integer and calculate its factorial.

1  declare
2      i int;
3      f int := 1;
4      begin
5        i := &i;
6        loop
7            exit when i <= 1;
8            f := f * i;
9            i := i - 1;
10       end loop;
11       dbms_output.put_line('Fact is ' || f);
12  end;


# The WHILE Loop ==>
====================

* A WHILE LOOP statement in PL/SQL programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

* Syntax:

WHILE condition LOOP
    statements;
END LOOP;


# WAP to print first 10 natural numbers using WHILE loop.

1  declare
2  i int := 1;
3  begin
4     while i <= 10 loop
5         dbms_output.put_line(i);
6         i := i + 1;
7     end loop;
8 end;


# Redesign the factorial program using WHILE loop.

1  declare
2  a int;
3  f int := 1;
4  begin
5     a := &a;
6     while a > 1 loop
7         f := f * a;
8         a := a - 1;
9     end loop;
10    dbms_output.put_line('Fact is ' || f);
11 end;


# The FOR Loop ==>
==================

* PL/SQL FOR LOOP executes a sequence of statements a specified number of times.

* Syntax:

FOR index IN lower_bound .. upper_bound LOOP
    statements;
END LOOP;


# Important Points About FOR Loop ==>

- The index is an implicit variable.
- It is local to the FOR LOOP statement.
- In other words, we cannot reference it outside the loop.
- Inside the loop, we can reference index but we cannot change its value.
- After the FOR LOOP statement executes, the index becomes undefined.
- The lower_bound and upper_bound are evaluated once when the FOR LOOP statement starts.
- Their values are stored as temporary PLS_INTEGER values.
- If we modify the values of lower_bound or upper_bound insidethe loop, the change will have no effect because they are evaluated once only before the first loop iteration starts.
- If index is less than upper_bound, index is incremented by one, the statements execute, and control again returns to the top of the loop.
- When index is greater than upper_bound, the loop terminates, and control transfers to the statement after the FOR LOOP statement.

* When lower_bound is greater than upper_bound, the statements do not execute at all.


# WAP to print first 10 natural numbers using FOR loop.

1  declare
2  a int;
3  begin
4     for a in 1 .. 10 loop
5        dbms_output.put_line(a);
6     end loop;
7 end;


# WAP to calculate sum of first n natural numbers where n is to be taken from the user.

1  declare
2  a int;
3  s int := 0;
4  begin
5     a := &a;
6     for i in 1 .. a loop
7        s := s + i;
8     end loop;
9     dbms_output.put_line('Sum is ' || s);
10 end;


# WAP to calculate power of n to p , where n and p are to be taken from the user.

1  declare
2  n int;
3  p int;
4  a int := 1;
5  begin
6     n := &n;
7     p := &p;
8     for i in 1 .. p loop
9        a := a * n;
10     end loop;
11     dbms_output.put_line(a);
12 end;


# Running FOR Loop In Reverse ===>

* The following shows the structure of the FOR LOOP statement with REVERSE keyword:

* Syntax :-
FOR index IN REVERSE lower_bound .. upper_bound LOOP
    statements;
END LOOP;

* With the `REVERSE` keyword, the index is set to upper_bound and decreased by one in each loop iteration until it reaches lower_bound.

1  begin
2     for i in reverse 1 .. 10 loop
3         dbms_output.put_line(i);
4     end loop;
5 end;
