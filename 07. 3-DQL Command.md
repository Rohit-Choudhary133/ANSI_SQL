===================================


## SELECT Command ====>
=======================

* The SELECT command is used to retrieve one or more rows from the table.

* The SELECT command has 2 versions:
- Select ………from <table_name>;
- Select ………from <table_name> Where <test_cond>;

* The first version retrieves all the rows.

* The second version is called SEARCHED SELECT as it uses the WHERE clause containing a CONDITION and retrieves or fetches only those rows whose data matches the given condition.

- Syntax: Select <list_of_columns> from <table_name>;

- Example: Suppose we want to view all the contents of Students table , then our command will be -
*  select std_id, s_name, dob from students;
               OR
*  Select * from Students;


# Column Aliasing With SELECT ===>

* The term column aliasing means changing the name of the column , just during the output of SELECT command.

- Syntax: Select <old_col_name> as <new_col_name> from <table_name>;

- Example: select std_id as roll_no, s_name as name, dob as birth_date from students;


   ROLL_NO NAME                           BIRTH_DATE

       104 Vikas                          20-SEP-91


# Example:
- Suppose we want to display all columns but only those rows where std_id is greater than 101 -
* select * from Students where std_id > 101;

    STD_ID S_NAME                         DOB
---------- ------------------------------ ---------

      104 Vikas                          20-SEP-91

- Suppose we want to display std_id and dob of student whose name is vikas: -
*  select * from students where s_name = 'Vikas';       

 STD_ID S_NAME                         DOB
---------- ------------------------------ ---------

##  Creating Copy Of The Table ====>

* Oracle allows us to create a copy of an existing table and for this we have to combine CREATE and SELECT commands.

- The general syntax is: 
   CREATE TABLE <table_name> as ( SELECT <list of cols> FROM <table> WHERE <test-cond>);

# Creating exact copy ---

- Create table Students2 as (Select * from Students);   

    STD_ID S_NAME                         DOB
---------- ------------------------------ ---------

       103 Shivam                         08-MAR-02
       104 Vikas                          20-SEP-91


# Copying only selected columns ---

- create table students3 as (Select std_id, s_name from Students);

    STD_ID S_NAME

       102 Santosh
       103 Shivam
       104 Vikas


# Copying only selected columns but with different names ---

- create table students4 as (Select std_id as roll_no, s_name as name from Students);
                                     OR
- Create table Students4(roll_no,name) as (Select s_id,s_name from Students);

   ROLL_NO NAME
---------- ------------------------------
       101 Prashant
       102 Santosh
       103 Shivam
       104 Vikas


# Copying selected rows ---

- Create table Students5 as (Select * from Students where std_id > 102);

    STD_ID S_NAME                         DOB
---------- ------------------------------ ---------
       103 Shivam                         08-MAR-02
       104 Vikas                          20-SEP-91


# Copying only the structure not the data ---

- Create table Students6 as (Select * from Students where std_id < 501);
                              OR
- Create table Students6 as (Select * from Students where 1 = 2);

==> no rows selected


##  Inserting Data Of One Table In Another ===>

* Oracle allows us to insert data from one table to another and for this we have to combine INSERT and SELECT commands.

* Syntax is:
INSERT into <table_name> Select <list_of_cols> from <table_ name>;
 
* For the above command to work :
- The structure of both the tables must be same.
                     OR
- We must fetch only those columns from source table which are present in target table.

# Copying all data from Student to Student6 ---

- Insert into Student6 Select * from Students;

    STD_ID S_NAME                         DOB
---------- ------------------------------ ---------

       104 Vikas                          20-SEP-91

# Copying only selected columns ---

- Insert into Student6 Select std_id, s_name from Students;
                           OR
- Insert into Student6 Select std_id, s_name, null from Students;
