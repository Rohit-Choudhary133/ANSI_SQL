====================

* It is the most popular form of JOIN and is commonly used.

* An equijoin is a join with a join condition containing an equality operator , which is represented by (=) sign. 

* For equi join to work , it is compulsory that the tables being joined MUST HAVE a COMMON COLUMN 

* Syntax:
- SELECT column_list FROM table1, table2.... WHERE table1.column_name =table2.column_name;


# WAQ to display ename and dname of all the employees in the company.
-  select ename, dname from emp, dept where emp.deptno = dept.deptno;

## Using Table Aliases ===>
===========================

* Instead of using the table name as a prefix to differentiate between the columns, we also can use a table alias, which qualifies the table using a short abbreviation.

- select ename, dname, e.deptno from emp e, dept d where e.deptno = d.deptno;

ENAME      DNAME              DEPTNO

##  Equi Join And NULL ===>
===========================

* In an equijoin, a NULL value in the common column has the effect of not including the row in the result.

* A NULL value is not equal to any other value, including another NULL value.

* Therefore rows with NULL in join column are not included in the result.
