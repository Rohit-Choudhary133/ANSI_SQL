====================

* An outer join is similar to an equijoin because it returns all the records an equijoin returns.

* But it also returns records that are in one of the tables with no matching records in another table.

* An OUTER JOIN returns not only results which satisfy all conditions, but also returns rows from one table which did not satisfy the condition.

* In case of OUTER JOIN to work we first have to identify the deficittable.

* A table is called a DEFICIT TABLE if it does not contain a matching value in the join column as compared to the value of other table.

* Now , while writing the OUTER JOIN query the entire syntax is same as that of EQUI JOIN , but we place a + along with the column of DEFICIT TABLE in the JOIN CONDITION.
