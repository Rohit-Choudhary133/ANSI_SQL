================================


* Correlated subqueries are different from the simple subqueries in 2 ways:
- First, they allow us to reference columns from the outer query in the subquery.
- Second, they execute the inner query repeatedly.

* A CORRELATED SUBQUERY is so named because of the reference of a column from the OUTER QUERY.

* We use a CORRELATED SUBQUERY when we need to review every row of the OUTER QUERY against the result of the inner query.

* The INNER QUERY is executed repeatedly, each time specific to the correlated value of the outer query, while in previous examples the INNER QUERY executed only once.


# To understand the concept CORRELATED SUBQUERY , consider the following table.

Empno   Ename   Sal    Deptno
101     ALLEN  10000    10
102     SMITH   8000    10
103     BLAKE  10000    20
104     JAMES  15000    20

# WAQ to display ename and sal of highest paid employee of each department.
- SELECT e1.ename,e1.sal,e1.deptno FROM emp e1 Where e1.sal = (Select max(e2.sal) from emp e2 where e2.deptno = e1.deptno);

The output of the query will be correct and will be just 2 rows :
ALLEN 10000 10
JAMES 20000 20


# How Oracle Solves Correlated SubQueries ? 
===========================================

* As mentioned previously a CORRELATED SUBQUERY is handled in a completely different way as compared to NORMAL SUBQUERIES.

* In case of NORMAL SUBQUERIES Oracle evaluates the INNER QUERY only once and then uses itâ€™s result to solve the OUTER QUERY.

* But in case of CORRELATED SUBQUERIES , Oracle follows a different approach.

* In this Oracle , at first picks up a specific value from one row of the OUTER QUERY TABLE  runs the INNER QUERY for that specific value and then makes the COMPARISON.

* Like this for every rows of OUTER QUERY ,Oracle evaluates the INNER QUERY.


# Consider the following two tables.

* EMP
  Empno
  Ename
  Deptno
  Sal

* INVOICE
  Invoice_No
  Empno
  Amount
  Tour_Date


# WAQ to display ename of those employees who have earned more than their salay via touring
- SELECT ename FROM emp
Where sal < (Select sum(amount) from Invoice where
Invocie.empno=Emp.empno);  


# WAQ to display ename of those employees who went for a tour in last one year
