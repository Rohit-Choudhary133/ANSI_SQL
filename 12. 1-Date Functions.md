# Sysdate ==>
=============

* Return the current system date and time of the operating system.

# select sysdate from dual;

SYSDATE
---------
22-FEB-24


# Add_months() ==>
==================

* This function adds or subtract a number (n) representing month to a date and returns the same day n months away.

# select add_months (sysdate, 2) from dual;

ADD_MONTH
---------
22-APR-24

# select add_months ('30-Nov-2024', -3) from dual;

ADD_MONTH
---------
31-AUG-24


# Last_day() ==>
================

* This function takes a DATE argument and returns the last day of the month of that date.

# select last_day (sysdate) from dual;

LAST_DAY
--------
29-FEB-24

# select last_day ('28-Aug-2002') from dual;

LAST_DAY
---------
31-AUG-02


# Next_day() ==>
================

* This function returns the date of the first weekday specified by day name that is later than the given date.

#  select next_day (sysdate, 'Sunday') from dual;

NEXT_DAY
---------
25-FEB-24

# select next_day ('21-Mar-2026', 'Sunday') from dual;

NEXT_DAY
---------
22-MAR-26


# Months_between() ==>
======================

* This function returns the number of months between two dates.
* If date1 comes after date2, then MONTHS_BETWEEN returns a positive number.
* If date1 comes before date2, then MONTHS_BETWEEN returns a negative number.

# select months_between ('21-Mar-2024', '23-Jul-2024') from dual;

MONTHS_BETWEEN
---------------
-4.0645161

# select months_between ('21-Mar-2024', '21-Jan-2024') from dual;

MONTHS_BETWEEN
---------------
     2


# Greatest() ==>
================

* This function returns the greatest date from the set of dates passed as argument.

# select greatest (to_date('21-Mar-2024'), to_date('21-Apr-2024')) from dual;

GREATEST

21-APR-24


# Least() ==>
=============

* This function returns the smallest date from the set of dates passed as argument.

#  select least (to_date('1-Oct-2024'), to_date('1-Dec-2024')) from dual;

* This function extracts a specific component (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, etc.,) from the date passed as argument.

# SQL> select extract (year from sysdate) from dual;

EXTRACT(YEARFROMSYSDATE)
------------------------
                    2024

# select extract (month from sysdate) from dual;

EXTRACT(MONTHFROMSYSDATE)
-------------------------
                        2


## Oracle Date Arithmetic ====>
===============================

* We can perform lot of arithmetic operations on DATE datatype.
* These are :
- Adding or subtracting a number to or from a date.
- Subtracting two dates to find the number of days between those.
- Adding hours to a date.

#  select sysdate + 3 from dual;

SYSDATE+3
---------
25-FEB-24

# select sysdate - 23 from dual;

SYSDATE-2
---------
30-JAN-24

#  select sysdate - to_date('28-Aug-2002') from dual;

SYSDATE-TO_DATE('28-AUG-2002')

# WAQ to display number of days remaining in the current month ? 
- select last_day(sysdate) - sysdate from dual;

LAST_DAY(SYSDATE)-SYSDATE
-------------------------
                        6

# WAQ to display number of days remaining in the current Year ? 
- select last_day(to_date('01-Dec-2024')) - trunc(sysdate) as days from dual;
