===============================

* PL/SQL has two kinds of data types: scalar and composite.

* `Scalar`types are types that store single values such as Number, Boolean, Character, and Datetime.

* `Composite` types are types that store multiple values, for example, record & collection.

* PL/SQL divides the scalar data types into four families:
- Number
- Boolean
- Character
- Datetime


## Numeric Types ==>
====================

* The numeric data types represent real numbers, integers, and floating-point numbers.

* The data types for this are:
- `Number` :- Same as SQL data type Number.
- `PLS_INTEGER` :- Datatype is specific to PL/SQL. It represents signed 32 bits integers that range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
- `Integer or Int` :- An integer type with maximum precision of 38 decimal digits.
- `Float or Double Precision` :- For storing decimal values Boolean .


## Boolean Types ==>
====================

* The BOOLEAN data type has three data values: `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NULL`.

* Boolean values are typically used in control flow structure such as IF-THEN, CASE, and loop statements like LOOP, FOR LOOP, and WHILE LOOP.


## Character Types ==>
======================

* Character types let you store alphanumeric data, represent words and text, and manipulate character strings.

* Following are character types supported by PL-SQL:
- CHAR
- VARCHAR
- VARCHAR2
- RAW
- LONG


## DateTimeTypes ==>
====================

* The datetime data types represent dates and timestamp.

* The two popular types in this category are:
- `DATE`
- `TIMESTAMP` :- The TIMESTAMP data type allows us to store date and time data including year, month, day, hour, minute and second.
 In addition, it stores the fractional seconds, which is not stored by
the DATE data type.


## Two Special Types ==>
========================

* There are two special types also called %TYPE and %ROWTYPE.
- `%TYPE` :- is used to define the data type of variable as the column name datatype specified for a table.

- `%ROWTYPE` :- Used to declare a record with the same types as found in the specified table.


## Rules For Variable Declaration ===>
======================================

* Variable names cannot be longer than 30 characters.

* They must begin with an alphabetical character. Although we can have numbers and certain special characters in the name, but the first character must be an alpha character.

* They can contain only alphabetical characters, numbers, or one of the following special characters: # $ _

* Variable names are not case sensitive.


# Variable Declaration ==>
==========================

* PL/SQL variables must be declared in the declaration section with the following syntax:
* Syntax :-
# Variable_name datatype(size);

* Example :-
# roll_no NUMBER(2); 
# a int;


# Variable Assignment ==>
=========================

* Whenever we declare a variable, PL/SQL assigns it a default value of NULL.

* If we want to initialize a variable with a value other than the NULL value, we can do so during the declaration, using either of the following −
- The DEFAULT keyword
- The assignment operator which is :=

* Example :-
# counter int:= 0;
# greetings varchar2(20) DEFAULT 'Have a Good Day';


# PL-SQL Constants ==>
======================

* Constants are those values which when declared remain fixed throughout the PL/SQL block.

* For declaring constants, a constant keyword is used.

* Syntax :- 
# Constant_Name constant Datatype(size) :=<value>;

* Example :-
# school_name constant VARCHAR2(20) := “DPS";


# PL-SQL Comments ==>
=====================

* PL/SQL has two comment styles: single-line and multi-line comments.

* `Single Line Comments` :- A single-line comment starts with a double hyphen ( --) that can appear anywhere on a line and extends to the end of the line.

- Example :-
# -- a:=10;

* `Multi Line Comments` :- A multi-line comment starts with a slash-asterisk ( /* ) and ends with an asterisk-slash ( */ ), and can span multiple lines:

- Example:
# /* This is a multi-line comment
#   that can span multiple lines */
