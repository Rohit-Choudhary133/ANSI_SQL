==================

* Instead of qualifying the name of an object with the object owner’s name, we can use a synonym.

* A synonym is a way of aliasing an object with another name. 

* Synonyms are of two types:
- private synonym
- public synonym

* A private synonym is a synonym in a user’s schema; while public synonyms are visible to everyone.

* We use the command CREATE SYNONYM for creating a synonym , whose syntax is

* Syntax:
- CREATE SYNONYM <synonym_name> FOR <resource_name>;


## Private Synonyms ==>
=======================

* We use the command CREATE SYNONYM for creating a synonym , whose syntax is

* Syntax:
- CREATE SYNONYM <synonym_name> FOR <resource_name>;

* The next CREATE SYNONYM command creates a private synonym called BOOKS in the INDIAN schema for the ALLBOOKS table located in the ORACLEBATCH schema. 

# CREATE SYNONYM books FOR ORACLEBATCH.ALLBOOKS;

* After the synonym is successfully created in the INDIAN schema, we can select from the ALLBOOKS table by the name BOOKS and that too without prefixing with the schema name.


# Point To Remember ==>
=======================

* When we create a synonym, the validity of the underlying object is not checked; that is, we can create a synonym without the object existing.

* The synonym is created without error, but we get an error message if we attempt to access the synonym.

* The following synonym, called SYNONYM_TEST, is based on
a nonexistent TEST_ME object, which could be a view, a table,
another synonym, or another type of Oracle object.
CREATE SYNONYM synonym_test FOR test_me;


## Public Synonyms ==>
======================

* All synonyms are private unless the keyword PUBLIC is specified.

* Public synonyms are visible to all users of the database.

* However, object privileges are not automatically granted to the underlying objects so we still need to issue grants to users by referring to either the public synonym or the underlying object. 

* For the user ORACLEBATCH, the following statements create a table, create a public synonym for the table, and grant the SELECT privilege on the table to the user INDIAN.

- CREATE TABLE PERSON(p_id number(3), p_name varchar2(15));
- CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM PEOPLE FOR PERSON;
- GRANT SELECT ON PEOPLETO INDIAN;

* Now the user INDIAN can perform queries against the public synonym or the table PERSON by the name PEOPLE located in the ORACLEBATCH schema.

* The user INDIAN—or, for that matter, any other user—does not need to prefix the PEOPLE table with the owner. 

* However, a public synonym does not mean that users other than the user INDIAN have access to the table.

* If we want every user in the database system to have SELECT privileges, we can grant the SELECT privilege to PUBLIC by using the following command:

# GRANT SELECT ON personTO PUBLIC


##  Dropping Synonyms ===>
==========================

* We drop synonyms by using the DROP SYNONYM command.

* The next commands drop the BOOKS synonym and the public PEOPLE synonym.

# DROP SYNONYM BOOKS;
# DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM PEOPLE;


##  Renaming Synonyms ===>
==========================

* If a synonym already exists and we want to change its definition, we can use the CREATE OR REPLACE SYNONYM command instead of dropping and re-creating a synonym. 

# CREATE OR REPLACE PUBLIC SYNONYM LIB_BOOKS FOR BOOKS;

* The RENAME command renames a synonym.
# RENAME LIB_BOOKSTO MYBOOKS;
