=======================

* A natural join joins tables based on the columns with the same name and data type.

* Here there is no need to prefix the column name with the table alias, and the join is indicated with the keywords NATURAL JOIN.

* There is not even a mention of which column(s) to join.

* Any use of the ON clause is also not allowed with the NATURAL JOIN keywords, and the common columns cannot list a table alias.

* Syntax:
- SELECT columns FROM table1 NATURAL JOIN table2 ;

# WAQ to display ename ,dname and deptno of all the employees in the company.
- select ename, dname, deptno from emp natural join dept;

ENAME      DNAME              DEPTNO
