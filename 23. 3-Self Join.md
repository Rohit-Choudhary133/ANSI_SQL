=====================

* A self-join joins a table to itself by pretending there are different tables involved.

* This is accomplished by using table aliases. 

* One table has one alias, and the same table also has another alias.

* For the purpose of executing the query, Oracle treats them as two different tables.

* Syntax:
- SELECT a.column_name, b.column_name... FROM table1 a, table1 b WHERE a.col = b.col;
