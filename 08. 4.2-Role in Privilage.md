=============

* A role is several privileges collected under one name.

* Using roles aids in administration of multiple privileges to users.

* Oracle includes predefined roles; three popular ones that contain a number of different system privileges are CONNECT, RESOURCE, and DBA.

* The CONNECT role contains the CREATE SESSION system privilege that allows a user to start a session.

* The RESOURCE role allows a user to create tables and indexes on any tablespace as well as create PL/SQL packages, procedures, functions etc.

* The DBA role includes all system privileges. This role is usually granted to a user who performs database administration tasks.

* When a user is granted a role, the user acquires all the privileges defined within the role.

* The following statement uses the two predefined Oracle roles CONNECT and RESOURCE to grant a number of system privileges to the new user.
# GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO INDIAN;


## User Defined Roles ===>
==========================

* In addition to using Oracleâ€™s predefined system privilege roles we can create user-defined roles to customize a grouping of system and/or object privileges.

* There may be different types of users for a given system:

* Sometimes, there are users who only view data, so those users need only SELECT privileges.

* There are other users who maintain the data, and they typically need a combination of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE privileges on certain tables and columns.

* In such cases we can create roles , add privileges to those roles as per requirement and finally assign these roles as needed to users.

* The syntax to create a role is as follows.
# CREATE ROLE ROLENAME ;

* The following statement creates a role named READ_DATA for users who only need to query the data in the ORACLEBATCH schema.
# CREATE ROLE READ_DATA;


##  Adding Privileges To Role ===>
==================================

* However , the role still does not have any privileges associated with it.

* So to add privileges to a role we use following syntax:
- GRANT <list_of_privileges>
    ON <resource_name>
    TO <role_name>;

* Example:
- GRANT SELECT
  ON EMP
  TO READ_DATA;  


##  Granting Role To Users ===>
===============================

* The next step is to grant the READ_DATA role to users so these users have the privileges defined by the role.

* The following statement grants this role to the user INDIAN.
# GRANT READ_DATA TO INDIAN;

* Now the user INDIAN has SELECT privileges on EMP table of ORACLEBATCH schema.


##  Revoking Roles ===>
=======================

* We can revoke role from a user by using the following REVOKE command.
# REVOKE READ_DATA FROM INDIAN;


##  Revoking Privileges From Roles ===>
=======================================

* If we want none of the users to have the SELECT privilege to the EMP table anymore, then we can revoke this privilege from the individual role only, and all users that have been granted this role will no longer have the ability to query the table.

* Syntax:
- REVOKE <list_of_privileges>
  ON <resource_name>
  FROM <role_name>;

* Example:
- REVOKE SELECT ON EMP FROM READ_DATA;


##  Removing Roles ===>
=======================

* We drop roles by using the DROP ROLE command.
# DROP ROLE READ_DATA;
