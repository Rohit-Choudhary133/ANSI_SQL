====================================

* Instead of giving this join query again and again, we can create a view on these tables and this view is called a JOIN VIEW.

* Syntax Of Join View :-
- CREATE VIEW view_name As ( <join query> );

* Example:
- create view emp_dpt
  2  as (select ename, empno, sal, emp.deptno, dname, loc
  3  from emp, dept
  4  where emp.deptno = dept.deptno);

- select * from emp_dpt;

ENAME           EMPNO        SAL     DEPTNO DNAME          LOC

##  Modifications On A Join View ===>
=====================================

* Before we can understand what modifications are allowed on a JOIN VIEW , we first have to understand the concept of KEY PRESERVED TABLE.

* A table is considered KEY PRESERVED if PRIMARY KEY of the table can also be a PRIMARY KEY of the VIEW.

* In other words if in the output shown by the view the uniqueness of the PRIMARY KEY is still maintained , then the table to which this key belongs is said to be a KEY PRESERVED table.

* In our example, the primary key EMPNO of the EMP table is still unique in the output of the view so EMP is a key preserved table.

* While the table DEPT is non key preserved because it’s PRIMARY KEY DEPTNO is not unique in the output of the view.


# UPDATION RULE: ==>
====================

* All the columns which can be updated through a JOIN VIEW must belong to the key preserved table.

* Moreover if WITH CHECK OPTION is enabled , then column used for join cannot be updated.

* Example :-
- update emp_dpt
  2  set sal = sal + 1000
  3  where empno = 7900;


# DELETION RULE: ==>
====================

* We can delete from a JOIN VIEW provided there is only one key preserved table and the data will also be lost from the key preserved table.

* In the view emp_det we can execute the delete command since there is only one key preserved table and the data lost will be from the EMP table.


# INSERTION RULE: ==>
=====================

* For insert to work on a JOIN VIEW it should not have the WITH CHECK OPTION enabled and also we can just insert the data in the key preserved table.

* Example :- 
- INSERT emp_det (empno,ename,sal)
   VALUES ( 105,’Deepesh’,50000);


##  Obtaining Details About Views ===>
======================================

* Whenever we create a view on a table , then Oracle internally maintains it’s details in it’s DATA DICTIONARIES.

* For views , Oracle has 2 DATA DICTIONARIES:
- USER_VIEWS
- USER_UPDATABLE_COLUMNS

* The first dictionary contain details of all the views of the current user while second dictionary contains information about the columns of the view which can be modified.


# USER_VIEWS: ==>
=================

* It contains the following useful columns:
- VIEW_NAME: Stores the name of the view
- TEXT: Stores the select query used to create the view
- READ_ONLY: Contains a single character to denote whether the view is read only or not.

* Example :- 
# WAQ to display text of the view STAFF.
- select text from user_views where view_name = 'MYSTAFF';

TEXT
-------------------------------
(select empno, ename from emp)


# USER_UPDATABLE_COLUMNS: ==>
=============================

* It contains the following useful columns:
- TABLE_NAME: Stores the name of the view
- COLUMN_NAME: Stores a name of column contained in the view
- INSERTABLE: Contains YES or No to indicated whether the column is insertable or not
- UPDATABLE: Contains YES or No to indicated whether the column is updatable or not
- DELETABLE: Contains YES or No to indicated whether the column is deletabe or not

* Example :-
# WAQ to display column name and whether they can be inserted ,updated or deleted for the view STAFF.
- select table_name, column_name, insertable, deletable, updatable
  2  from user_updatable_columns
  3  where table_name = 'MYSTAFF';

TABLE_NAME                     COLUMN_NAME                    INS DEL UPD
------------------------------ ------------------------------ --- --- ---
MYSTAFF                        EMPNO                          YES YES YES
MYSTAFF                        ENAME                          YES YES YES


##  Removing Views ===>
=======================

* When a view is no longer needed, we can drop it with the DROP VIEW command.

* Syntax: DROP VIEW <view_name>;
* Example: drop view mystaff;


##  General Restrictions On View ===>
=====================================

* Prior to Oracle 11g ,the SELECT query used to define a view cannot contain ORDER BY clause.

* So the following is wrong
- CREATE VIEW Staff As (Select ename,sal from emp order by sal); 

* As an alternate to this , when we access the view , we can use ORDER BY clause

* So the following is correct :-
- CREATE VIEW mystaff As (Select ename,sal from emp);
- SELECT * from mystaff Order by sal;

* If a view contains a GROUP BY clause , then it cannot be updated.

* So the following view cannot be updated.
- CREATE VIEW Dept_details As (Select deptno,max(sal) sal from emp group by deptno); 

* If a view contains any GROUP FUNCTION or DERIVED COLUMN or any SCALAR FUNCTION , then that column needs to be aliased.

* So the following view cannot be updated.
- CREATE VIEW Income_details as (Select empno, sal+nvl(comm,0) as Income from emp);
