============================

* PL/SQL language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators âˆ’
- Arithmetic operators
- Relational operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Miscellaneous Operators


## Arithmetic Operators ===>
============================

Operator     Description                                                Example
========    =============                                              =========
+            Adds two operands                                     A + B will give 15
-            Subtracts second operand from the first               A - B will give 5
*            Multiplies both operands                              A * B will give 50
/            Divides numerator by de-numerator                     A / B will give 2
**           Exponentiation operator, raises one operand to        A ** B will give 100000
             the power of other           
                                                                        

## Miscellaneous Operators  ===>
================================

Operator                   Description
=========                  ============
| |                        Concatenation
IN , NOT IN                Comparison for a value in a specified list
BETWEEN , NOT BETWEEN      Comparison based on range of values
LIKE , NOT LIKE            Used for pattern matching
IS ,IS NOT                 Used for comparing NULL values


##  WAP to Print 2 No. Sum ===>

- 1  declare
  2  a int;
  3  b int;
  4  c int;
  5  begin
  6  a:=&a;
  7  b:=&b;
  8  c:=a + b;
  9  dbms_output.put_line('No. are ' || a || ' and ' || b);
 10  dbms_output.put_line('Sum is ' || c);
 11* end;

- 
Enter value for a: 10
old   6: a:=&a;
new   6: a:=10;
Enter value for b: 20
old   7: b:=&b;
new   7: b:=20;
No. are 10 and 20
Sum is 30
